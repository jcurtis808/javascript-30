# What I learned Today

### 5.11.20 #JS30 day 1

- 'audio' element: never used an audio tag before and learned that you can use src files from your project director, or stream from the web. It also comes with predefined methods for addings controls, starting/stopping playback etc. 
- querySelector and querySelectorAll: sometimes better than getElement____ because you can use a variety of CSS selectors in querySelector instead of having to use multiple getElement(s)By____. Learned about designating specific custom attributes, specifically data attributes. -> div[data-key='${e.keyCode}'] selects an attribute of "data-key" with a value of event.keyCode (keyboard input). Very clarifying especially using ES6 as attribute value. 
- refresher on forEach....always nice to have loop refreshers for me? Guess I need to work on them more. I know when I need to be looping but still struggle to get the right syntax and where to attach the loop :/
- commenting in code....didn't do it very much while actually coding, but went back in to add later. Going to be better about commenting as I code to help me and others. 
- Want to be better about planning out / thinking out my course of action before typing lots of attempts. 
- used the video for hints earlier than I would've liked...I'll be better tomorrow

### 5.12.20 #JS30 day 2

- Had a rough day today because I didn't push myself hard enough to try and solve the challenge on my own before watching the video. I still learned a lot though, mostly about thinking logically in JS and controlling CSS elements with JS. 
- Was able to look up all of the js methods etc that I needed but had a really hard time understanding how that will transfer into CSS. 
- Realizing that I definitely need to improve my CSS skills a lot. 
- learned about css transform properties finally...
- even though the calculations and math weren't difficult, it really opened my eyes and mind to thinking in a different way. 
- I am feeling comfortable with my DOM manipulation and selecting DOM elements though :) 

### 5.13.20 #JS30 day 3
    
- Today was *much* better than yesterday -- phew. Had a nice chat with Dan about my day yesterday and just frustration in general, really helped. 
- Took things a little slower today and tried to think as logically as I could and simplify things into basic actions that I knew how to do. 
- I was able to solve the challenge on my own before watching the video :) *however* Wes's solution was definitely cleaner and simpler than mine which is great! I feel so much better than I was able to come to any solution and then learn a better one. The entire time though I had a feeling that I should be doing something different and actually thought about using a forEach the way Wes did but wasn't quite sure how I would do that. 
- .dataset was **very** helpful to learn about today -- love that. Now I'm starting to understand why Wes codes his HTML the way he does...very practical and efficient, and I love that it seems formatted in a way that allows your to maximize your JS and use more of it. 
- used an arrow function again today that ruined the value of ```this``` but that's okay because I realized why it was happening this time and switched the function to function declaration instead. 
- I used an eventListner that was more efficient that Wes's in my opinion -- 'input' rather than 'change' and 'mousemove'. Not sure if 'input' wasn't available when Wes made the videos (2016?).
- Forced myself to add custom CSS and styles which I never usually do....and I actually enjoyed doing it. I know that I need to get much more comfortable with CSS and layout in general so I'm glad I did that. 
- Even though I had never heard of CSS variables before today, I feel like I understand them very well now and really understood and enjoyed today's challenge. onward and upward! 

### 5.14.20 #JS30 day 4
    
 

### 5.18.20 #JS30 day 8
- Don't forget creativity! Be creative with solutions -- create variables that solve problems. Created a ```isDrawing``` variable that switched between true and false depending on evnets that were triggered. There isn't always going to be a perfect event that will do exactly what you need it to, so essentially create your own with variables and simple functions & conditionals :)
- This was crucial and simple to get a 'mouseover' event to only log events when the mouse button is pressed down :)
