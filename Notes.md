## What I learned Today

**5.11.20 #JS30 day 1**

  - <audio> element: never used an audio tag before and learned that you can use src files from your project director, or stream from the web. It also comes with predefined methods for addings controls, starting/stopping playback etc. 
  - querySelector and querySelectorAll: sometimes better than getElement____ because you can use a variety of CSS selectors in querySelector instead of having to use multiple getElement(s)By____. Learned about designating specific custom attributes, specifically data attributes. -> div[data-key='${e.keyCode}'] selects an attribute of "data-key" with a value of event.keyCode (keyboard input). Very clarifying especially using ES6 as attribute value. 
  - refresher on forEach....always nice to have loop refreshers for me? Guess I need to work on them more. I know when I need to be looping but still struggle to get the right syntax and where to attach the loop :/
  - commenting in code....didn't do it very much while actually coding, but went back in to add later. Going to be better about commenting as I code to help me and others. 
  - Want to be better about planning out / thinking out my course of action before typing lots of attempts. 
  - used the video for hints earlier than I would've liked...I'll be better tomorrow
